# Potential Issues with the Project

1. How would you prevent the attacker from accessing other users folder structure, if the attacker knows the folder structure of the application and the authentication token of the user?

2. Have you accounted for different types of error handling in the project?

3. It also raises a question about error handling using callbacks and error handling using promises. How would you handle errors in both cases?
